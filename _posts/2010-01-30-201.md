Google have recently started a video rental service on YouTube. Unfortunately it's only available in the US atm.ÏÏ/p>

I find the language of the notification telling me this to be quite interesting.

![This video contains content from Lionsgate (Shop), who has decided to block it from your country.']({{ site.mediaurl }}/images/Screen-shot-2010-01-30-at-03.37.02.png)

Not "This content is unavailable in your country", not "Who currently cannot provide this content to people in your country". They have actively tried to block it in your country.

They've turned something from what is normally a passive "we're sorry, but we can't do that" into an active "we have made a decision to proactively not do that".
