The social web has exploded, and with it the amount of content one can consume on a single social site, let alone half a dozen. Sorting the wheat from the chaff can be a difficult talk when faced with hundreds of messages after going back to doing work for even just a minute.

To combat this, services have taken to crowd-sourcing to give a better indication of what is worth your time. Websites like StackOverflow and Reddit allow you to vote on whether you think a particular entry is worthwhile or not, and even Facebook as an "I like this" feature.

Yet, with different wording these similar features end up quite different. With StackOverflow and Reddit it is clear that if you think an entry is worthwhile, you upvote it, and if you think it's detrimental or an utter waste of time you downvote it.

Of course, there are ambiguities in between and all sorts of tactical voting. What if you think something is mediocre? Do you just not vote? What if you think it's mediocre, but not worth the 10 downvotes it has? Do you upvote to counter?

But one thing is clear &mdash; if you think something is good, worthwhile, and other people should see it, you upvote it.

Contrast that with Facebook, which allows you to say "I like this". The purpose is unclear. Do they like this because the content is good? Do they like this because they think other people should pay attention? It seems to be using a feature to say two different things &mdash; one being your opinion of the content, and the other your opinion about the contents importance.

Maybe it wasn't Facebooks intent for the feature to be used to increase the visibility of posts, but it's certainly being used that way. And it leads to odd scenarios like

<img src="http://www.morethannothing.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-26-at-04.14.24.png" alt="" title="'My cat just died :(' - 3 people liked this." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-186" />

Of course, knowing whether someone liked something on Facebook because of the content or its importance is largely inconsequential, and indeed mostly self-evident by looking at the post (assuming you only know nice people who wouldn't like bad things).

But recently I stumbled across a link to The Conservative Party's [Draft Manifesto](http://www.conservatives.com/Draft_Manifesto.aspx) website. Here they use [Google Moderator](http://moderator.appspot.com/) to allow you to submit questions about their draft manifesto, and vote on other peoples questions. The most popular questions will be addressed by David Cameron. Despite, like all of these things, having a slightly cheesy 'Down with the kids' air to it, I genuinely applaud it as a nice move towards making it easier to get questions answered.

The problem is, though, that people suck at writing questions. For it to be productive, questions must be phrased neutrally so that people of conflicting opinions on the point can listen to the answer and evaluate their response.

Instead, questions are charged with opinion and bias. Take this one for instance

 > "Why not scrap teacher training colleges. They are a hotbed of "liberal" attitudes... and who needs 3 years to learn to be a teacher. A first degree (2.1 minimum) plus a PGCE or similar is a more appropriate career path into teaching." - [Elephant](http://moderator.appspot.com/?embed=http://www.conservatives.com/Draft_Manifesto.aspx#11/e=128e0e&t=agltb2RlcmF0b3JyLwsSCERvcnlVc2VyIiF1ODhhZWVhODM1ZDQ0YzU1NWY5MWViYzVlNGIxOTQzMmYM)

Do I think it's a good question? No. I think it's a terrible question terribly written. I think it's wrong and as a "liberal" I find it slightly insulting. But I want to heard David Camerons answer? Certainly. So I voted it a good question.

And as I went through upvoting these biased questions I couldn't help but notice a niggling worry in the back of my mind - what if, by virtue of a question being popular, they consider the biased view of the questions author to be representative of all who voted for it?

This time its not really Google's fault for creating this potential misunderstanding. To be fair, the more accurate alternative 'I would like to hear an answer to this' is a tad wordy. It's more that there is an onus on the people running these polls to interpret the results responsibly.

Am I being too paranoid? Probably. I hope so. Otherwise say goodbye to teacher training colleges and an increase in institutionalised sexism.
