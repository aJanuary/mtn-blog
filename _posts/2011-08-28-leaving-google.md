It&#39;s now come to the point where I can no longer, in good concious, continue to use Google+. Not while they continue to try and enforce their so-called &quot;real name&quot; policy.

There are many perfectly legitimate reasons why people would want to use different names. What&#39;s more, there are many legitimate reasons why people might want to present different names to different people. With circles, Google+ is half way to a technical solution for that - but they&#39;re hindered by policy.

I understand the desire for a stable identity. It breeds a more responsible community and it allows Google to build services around it (including, but by no means limited to advertising). But a stable identity does not necessitate a single real-world name.

Not that it&#39;s currently implemented as a real-world name. In their desperate attempts to stamp down on internet style pseudonyms they&#39;re banning people&#39;s legal names. Yes, someones first name is M3 and plenty of people do have only one name - not just celebrities - and yes, people do have a mix of non-english and english characters in their name.

As for the old &quot;If it bothers you, you don&#39;t have to use it&quot; line, try telling that to someone hiding from an abusive partner as their work colleagues try to get them to join in order to share the company BBQ pictures.
